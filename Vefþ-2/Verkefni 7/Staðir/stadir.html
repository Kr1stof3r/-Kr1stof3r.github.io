            Hotel Heydalur is located in the beautiful valley of Heydalur, around 320 km from Reykjavík and 130 km from
            Ísafjörður. The hotel offers 59 beds in 19 rooms (all with private WC) as well as three summer cottages.
            The hotel also operates a campsite (open from June 1 until the end of October) with warm showers, flushing
            toilets and ample electricity plugs for RVs and trailers.
            <br><br>
            Heydalur has recently been nominated as the best bathing site in the Westfjords area. Near the hotel you
            will find two outdoor, geothermal hot tubs, as well as a small pool inside a tropical greenhouse. On the
            other side of the river Heydalsá you will find yet another natural hot tub.
            <br><br>
            The opportunities for recreation and activities are almost endless. The hotel has a playground for children
            and youth, but also offers guided kayaking and horse riding tours that are suitable for most people. There
            are numerous hiking routes available, birdwatching is excellent during summer and freshwater fishing is also
            possible. During winter, visitors can enjoy snowshoeing, cross-country skiing and, of course, the magic of
            the northern lights.
            <br><br>
            Hörgshlíðarlaug hot spring is located in the lap of the beautiful Mjóifjörður fjords in the Westfjords of
            Iceland. Part of private property, Hörgshlíðarlaug hot spring offers an exquisite view over the fjord. Those
            who feel tired from all the roaming around across the vicinity can stop for a casual dip in this hot spring.
            Sitting at the boundary of the sea, Hörgshlíðarlaug is located with high and strong mountains watching over
            it. Usually, you can notice how many other hidden hot springs in Iceland are left to their fate. This hot
            water pool is different as it has not been left abandoned to its natural state. Here you can find a well-
            built concrete pool for visitors to relax in.

      <h1>Svartifoss</h1>
      <div class="colm2">
        <div>
          <p class="meginmal">
            Svartifoss is best renowned for the hexagonal basalt columns that surround it and lay shattered at its base.
            These columns, which are very dark, lend the feature its name; Svartifoss means ‘Black Falls’.
            These columns are found in other places in Iceland, such as the Gerðuberg cliffs on the Snæfellsnes
            Peninsula, and on Reynisfjara beach on the South Coast. At none of these locations, however, is there a
            cascade of foaming white water to add to the beauty and fantasy of the site.
            <br><br>

            The geology surrounding Svartifoss has inspired many artists and architects, spanning generations. To list
            them all would be impossible, but perhaps the most notable is Hallgrímskirkja, the largest church in
            Reykjavík
            <br><br>

            Svartifoss is located in the Skaftafell Nature Reserve, a place once so beautiful it was once its own
            national park; since, it has become enveloped into the greater Vatnajökull National Park.

            This reserve is renowned for it diverse and spectacular sceneries. It is partly forested in birch, partly
            covered in lava, divided by rivers and streams, and has many glacier tongues and lagoons within its
            boundaries.

            To many, Svartifoss is its highlight. The hike from the Skaftafell Visitors’ Centre to the waterfall is just
            over thirty minutes, and though relatively easy, requires a reasonable level of fitness and decent hiking
            boots.
